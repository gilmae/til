# Today I Learned

A collection of information snippets for things I have learned about whatever I am using. Because all too often I learn it and then forget it.

There's a file, TOLEARN.mdown of the things I need to learn one day

Inspired by https://github.com/jbranchaud/til, and really that should be the first TIL entry
